The simplest way to change posts order (and more!) to create your own style!



== Description ==

The current version of the plugin adds the possibility to edit the display order of the posts on the main page, on the category pages and on the archive pages.

Posts can be sorted, among others by title, by type or by update date. 

In addition, you can specify whether you want to ignore pinned posts and arrange them in the normal order. 

You can also choose how many posts to display per page.
